# Language Transformation Guide
Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD)

Language shapes emotional experience.  
In EFD, language is not descriptive — it is *regulatory*.  
How clinicians speak can stabilize or destabilize the field, empower or shame the client, support autonomy or collapse it.

This guide provides trauma-informed, non-pathologizing language replacements for traditional psychiatric terminology.  
It helps clinicians speak in a way that:
- reduces shame  
- removes labels  
- preserves dignity  
- increases coherence  
- supports regulation  
- strengthens therapeutic alliance

# 1. Principles of EFD Language

## 1.1 Language Must Never Pathologize
Avoid labels like:
- disorder  
- dysfunction  
- illness  
- abnormal  
- symptoms  
- pathology  

EFD frames emotional states as **field movements**, not diseases.

---

## 1.2 Describe States, Not Identities
We replace:
- “You are depressed”  
- “You are bipolar”  
- “You have anxiety”  

with:
- “Your field is overwhelmed.”  
- “Your energy is oscillating.”  
- “You’re carrying a lot right now.”  

States change.  
Labels imprison.

---

## 1.3 Speak to the Nervous System, Not the Diagnosis
Talk to:
- activation  
- thresholds  
- coherence  
- safety  
- body signals  
- overwhelm  
- needs  

Not “symptoms.”

---

## 1.4 Language Must Increase Safety
Use words that:
- slow  
- soften  
- stabilize  
- normalize  
- validate  

Every phrase should encourage regulation.
