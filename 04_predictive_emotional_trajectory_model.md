# Predictive Emotional Trajectory Model (PETM)

The Predictive Emotional Trajectory Model (PETM) is the forecasting engine of Emotional Field Dynamics. It allows clinicians to anticipate emotional escalation, collapse, oscillation, or stabilization by modeling how an emotional vector will move through the stability field over time. This transforms mental health care from reactive crisis management into proactive, early-intervention practice.

## 1. Purpose of PETM

PETM enables clinicians to:
- foresee emotional states before they manifest
- identify early warning markers for destabilization
- prevent panic, shutdown, manic acceleration, or dissociation
- tailor interventions to redirect trajectories at the earliest phase
- track long-term emotional patterns with scientific precision
- replace guesswork with predictable field dynamics

Predictive capacity is essential for trauma-informed, consent-centered, non-pathologizing clinical care.

## 2. What Is an Emotional Trajectory?

An emotional trajectory is the path an emotional vector takes through the stability field over time. It is shaped by:

- the vector’s initial conditions (magnitude, velocity, momentum, etc.)
- the geometry of the field (coherence, sensitivity, elasticity, density)
- incoming stimuli (environment, relationships, sensory input)
- underlying physiological state (sleep, energy, autonomic tone)
- trauma-driven distortions (hyperarousal, collapse, oscillation)

A trajectory is not a mood—it is a **motion**.

## 3. The Core PETM Equation

A simplified form:

**Trajectory(t) = ∫ F(Field(t), E(t), Input(t)) dt**

Where:
- **Field(t)** = shape of the stability field at time t  
- **E(t)** = emotional vector at time t  
- **Input(t)** = stimuli or conditions impacting the vector  
- **F** = the lawful interaction between vector and field  

This integral describes how the vector evolves as it moves.

## 4. Early-Warning Indicators

Because vectors behave lawfully, clinicians can observe **precursors** that reliably predict trajectory outcomes.

### **A. Escalation Indicators**
- rising magnitude (M↑)
- increasing velocity (V↑)
- narrowing direction toward defensive or manic patterns (D→hyperactivation)
- momentum building (Mo↑)
- resonance spikes (R↑)
- declining coherence (C↓)

Common trajectories:
- panic  
- rage escalation  
- manic acceleration  

### **B. Collapse Indicators**
- magnitude falling (M↓)
- velocity slowing (V↓)
- threshold fatigue (elasticity↓)
- field-density increase (emotional heaviness)
- coherence fragmentation (C↓)

Common trajectories:
- shutdown  
- dissociation  
- depressive collapse  

### **C. Oscillation Indicators**
- alternating magnitude  
- unstable direction  
- rapid shift velocity  
- high resonance with relational cues  

Common trajectories:
- trauma-driven push-pull  
- emotional whiplash  
- rapid switching  

## 5. Trajectory Archetypes

PETM identifies common trajectory patterns clinicians can learn to recognize.

### **1. Hyperarousal Spiral**
- quick rise in magnitude  
- high velocity  
- narrowing into defensive direction  
- likely endpoint: panic or rage  

### **2. Collapse Funnel**
- energy dropping rapidly  
- coherence declining  
- field-density increasing  
- endpoint: dissociation or shutdown  

### **3. Mania-Acceleration Curve**
- rising energy + reduced thresholds  
- increased velocity and momentum  
- expanding direction toward engagement or grandiosity  
- endpoint: runaway activation  

### **4. Trauma Oscillation Loop**
- repeated cycles between hyperarousal and collapse  
- low coherence  
- endpoint: unpredictability, exhaustion  

### **5. Stabilization Pathway**
- coherence rising  
- velocity moderating  
- magnitude moderated  
- endpoint: integration, grounded presence  

## 6. Clinical Use of PETM

PETM offers clinicians:
- a non-pathologizing language for describing escalation (“rising vector velocity” instead of “symptoms worsening”)
- a framework for early intervention
- a way to model long-term patterns without diagnostic labels
- a safety tool for people vulnerable to panic, mania, shutdown, or trauma responses

Examples:

### **Case: Early Panic**
- M↑, V↑, R↑, C↓  
Early intervention: sensory grounding, relational co-regulation

### **Case: Early Depression Collapse**
- M↓, V↓, Mo↑ (stuck), field-density↑  
Early intervention: gentle activation, environmental change

### **Case: Early Mania**
- M↑↑, V↑↑, Mo↑, thresholds↓  
Early intervention: field-softening, sensory reduction, slowing input rate

## 7. Integrating PETM With SFM and EVE

PETM rests on:
- **EVE** (vector properties)
- **SFM** (field shape)
- **PETM** (trajectory through field space)

Together they create a complete model:
- EVE tells *what* is moving  
- SFM tells *where* it’s moving  
- PETM tells *where it’s going*  

This triad replaces diagnostic labels with dynamic understanding.

## 8. Predictive Clinical Advantages

With PETM, clinicians can:
- prevent crises before they occur  
- de-escalate early warning signals  
- interrupt harmful trajectories  
- tailor interventions to specific field distortions  
- create individualized maps for each client  
- build long-range emotional forecasts

This is the core technology behind non-pathologizing, trauma-informed early intervention.

## 9. Summary

PETM transforms mental health care by reframing emotional crises as predictable, lawful phenomena. Instead of reacting after destabilization, clinicians can anticipate and redirect emotional movement through a deep understanding of vector dynamics and field behavior.
