# Case Studies & Patterns in Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD)

This document presents clinical case studies that illustrate how Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD) identifies, interprets, and redirects emotional vectors and field distortions. These examples demonstrate how clinicians can apply EVE, SFM, and PETM in real-world settings without pathologizing clients or relying on traditional diagnostic categories.

Each case emphasizes:
- vector dynamics  
- field shape  
- trajectory prediction  
- field-level intervention  
- measurable changes across time  

These case studies are composites designed for educational purposes.

## Case Study 1: Hyperarousal Spiral (Panic Trajectory)

### **Presenting Pattern**
Client experiences sudden intense anxiety, rapid heart rate, tunnel vision, and fear of losing control. Episodes come on “out of nowhere.”

### **Vector Profile (EVE)**
- Magnitude: 5  
- Direction: defensive  
- Velocity: 5  
- Momentum: 4  
- Resonance: 5  
- Coherence: 1  

### **Field Profile (SFM)**
- Coherence: fragmented  
- Elasticity: brittle  
- Sensitivity: very high  
- Density: elevated  
- Attractor Basin: hyperarousal  
- Threshold Stability: low  

### **Trajectory (PETM)**
Escalation curve rising rapidly → panic episode likely within minutes if unaddressed.

### **Intervention**
- reduce sensory input (lights, sound)  
- slow clinician pacing and voice  
- grounding via weight and breath  
- orienting to present environment  
- relational presence  

### **Outcome**
Within minutes:  
- velocity decreases  
- magnitude downshifts  
- coherence increases  
- trajectory diverts from panic endpoint  

Within weeks:  
- fewer episodes  
- less sensitivity  
- increased threshold stability

## Case Study 2: Collapse Funnel (Shutdown/Dissociation)

### **Presenting Pattern**
Client reports exhaustion, numbness, emotional flatness, and sense of disconnection. Withdraws from social contact and daily tasks.

### **Vector Profile**
- Magnitude: 1  
- Direction: collapse  
- Velocity: 1  
- Momentum: 5  
- Resonance: 2  
- Coherence: 2  

### **Field Profile**
- Coherence: low  
- Elasticity: low  
- Sensitivity: low external / high internal  
- Density: heavy  
- Attractor Basin: collapse  
- Threshold Stability: fragile  

### **Trajectory**
Collapse funnel → high risk of deep dissociation or severe depressive episodes.

### **Intervention**
- gentle activation (movement, warmth)  
- minimal demands  
- predictable relational presence  
- environmental change  
- micro-success tasks  

### **Outcome**
After sessions:  
- magnitude increases to 2–3  
- velocity improves  
- density lightens  
- attractor basin weakens  

Client becomes more reachable and responsive.

## Case Study 3: Trauma Oscillation Loop (Push–Pull Pattern)

### **Presenting Pattern**
Client cycles between emotional closeness and sudden withdrawal, intense connection then abrupt shutdown, often triggered by relational cues.

### **Vector Profile**
- Magnitude: fluctuating  
- Direction: oscillatory  
- Velocity: rapid shifts  
- Momentum: unstable  
- Resonance: 5  
- Coherence: 1  

### **Field Profile**
- coherence: fragmented  
- elasticity: inconsistent  
- sensitivity: extremely high  
- density: elevated  
- attractor pattern: oscillation  
- thresholds: unpredictable  

### **Trajectory**
Oscillatory loop → risk of relational ruptures, overwhelm, emotional whiplash.

### **Intervention**
- stabilize relational pacing  
- provide consistent session structure  
- orient client before transitions  
- slow emotional processing  
- somatic containment between shifts  

### **Outcome**
Trauma-driven oscillation frequency decreases.  
Client begins experiencing longer periods of emotional continuity.

## Case Study 4: Mania-Acceleration Curve (High-Energy Trajectory)

### **Presenting Pattern**
Client experiences a surge of energy, fast speech, increased goal-driven behavior, reduced sleep, expansive ideas.

### **Vector Profile**
- Magnitude: 5  
- Direction: forward expansive  
- Velocity: 5  
- Momentum: 5  
- Resonance: 4  
- Coherence: 3  

### **Field Profile**
- coherence: moderate  
- elasticity: brittle  
- sensitivity: moderate  
- density: expanding internal load  
- attractor basin: high-energy  
- thresholds: rapidly dropping  

### **Trajectory**
Acceleration curve → likely endpoint: dangerous overstimulation or full runaway activation.

### **Intervention**
- reduce novelty and stimulation  
- slow conversation pace  
- encourage rest cycles  
- reduce social and sensory input  
- grounding through body-based techniques  

### **Outcome**
Field elasticity increases; thresholds stabilize.  
Trajectory slows enough to prevent escalation.

## Case Study 5: Defensive Constriction (Hypervigilance Pattern)

### **Presenting Pattern**
Client displays vigilance, rapid scanning, irritability, difficulty relaxing, and distrust of relational cues.

### **Vector Profile**
- Magnitude: 3–4  
- Direction: defensive  
- Velocity: moderate  
- Momentum: 4  
- Resonance: 5  
- Coherence: 2  

### **Field Profile**
- coherence: low  
- elasticity: brittle  
- sensitivity: very high  
- density: tight  
- attractor basin: defensive constriction  
- thresholds: narrow  

### **Trajectory**
Chronic defensive field → risk of burnout, relational rupture, or sudden shutdown under stress.

### **Intervention**
- create environmental predictability  
- non-threatening relational stance  
- slow exposure to input  
- grounding and consistency  
- cognitive boundary reinforcement  

### **Outcome**
Field widens, vigilance softens, and relational safety increases.

## Common Patterns Across Cases

### **1. Escalation Patterns**
- panic spirals  
- manic acceleration  
- defensive arousal  

### **2. Collapse Patterns**
- numbing  
- shutdown  
- dissociation  

### **3. Oscillation Patterns**
- trauma push–pull  
- emotional volatility  
- alternating activation  

### **4. Stabilization Patterns**
- rising coherence  
- diminishing reactivity  
- vector integration  

These patterns offer clinicians predictable frameworks for understanding and intervening without diagnosing or pathologizing the client.

## Summary

These case studies demonstrate how EFD’s vector, field, and trajectory models work in practice. By assessing vector motion, field shape, and future trajectory, clinicians can intervene early, prevent crises, and support healing through field-level transformation — without coercion, force, or disease-labeling.
