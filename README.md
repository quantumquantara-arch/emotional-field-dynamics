# Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD)

A clinical, mathematical, and trauma-informed framework for understanding mental and emotional life without diagnostic labels, coercion, or pathology.  
EFD treats emotions as **dynamic vectors** moving within a **stability field**, shaped by trauma, development, environment, physiology, and social context.  
This repository provides the full theoretical model, assessment tools, clinical protocols, training curriculum, and research methodology for coherence-based mental health practice.

EFD is built for clinicians, therapists, researchers, crisis workers, social care professionals, and scholars seeking a humane, non-medicalizing alternative to mainstream psychiatric paradigms.

# ✦ Why EFD Exists

Traditional mental health models rely on:
- diagnostic labels  
- coercive interventions  
- medication-dependent chronicity  
- pathologizing narratives  
- state-driven authority structures  

These approaches do not adequately explain or improve long-term outcomes.  
EFD offers a **non-pathologizing, non-coercive, evidence-based** alternative grounded in:

- emotional vector mathematics  
- stability field modeling  
- predictive trajectory mapping  
- environmental field design  
- trauma-informed relational practice  
- human rights frameworks  
- socio-cultural and gendered analysis  

Instead of “disorders,” EFD maps **field movements**, **thresholds**, and **patterns of overwhelm** that can be stabilized, reshaped, and integrated.

# ✦ Foundational Lineage

EFD stands on the shoulders of five leading thinkers and investigators who exposed the failures of coercive psychiatry and reframed human suffering through evidence, ethics, trauma, human rights, and socio-political power:

### **Robert Whitaker**  
Investigated psychiatric outcomes, long-term medication harms, and the evidence crisis in diagnostic practice.

### **Dr. Peter Breggin**  
Championed ethical, consent-based treatment and exposed coercive, abusive, and harmful psychiatric interventions.

### **Rob Wipond**  
Documented civil-liberties violations, misuse of involuntary psychiatric holds, police involvement, and state overreach.

### **Dr. Gabor Maté**  
Reframed emotional suffering as trauma-rooted, meaningful, and embodied rather than pathological.

### **Dr. Jessica Taylor**  
Exposed weaponized psychiatric labels, misogyny in diagnosis, institutional betrayal, and the pathologizing of trauma responses—especially in women and survivors.

These five together form the ethical, research, human-rights, trauma, and socio-political foundation from which Emotional Field Dynamics emerges.
