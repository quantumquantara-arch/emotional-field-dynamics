# EFD Training Curriculum Overview
A Three-Level Professional Certification for Clinicians, Therapists, and Mental Health Practitioners

This curriculum outlines the full training pathway for Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD). It is designed for clinicians, therapists, social workers, psychiatrists, crisis responders, researchers, and allied professionals who wish to practice EFD safely, ethically, and effectively.

EFD training emphasizes:
- non-pathologizing practice
- trauma-informed orientation
- non-coercive care
- early intervention
- predictive field modeling
- relational pacing
- somatic and autonomic regulation
- emotional-vector mathematics (EVE)
- stability field mapping (SFM)
- long-term transformation

Completion of all levels leads to full EFD Practitioner Certification.

# PROGRAM SUMMARY

### Level 1 → Foundations  
Language, ethics, field basics, somatic safety.

### Level 2 → Application  
Trajectory modeling, early intervention, relational pacing, crisis prevention.

### Level 3 → Mastery  
Advanced field work, complex trauma, supervision, systems integration.

Together, these levels establish a complete, humane, non-coercive, trauma-informed, field-based alternative to traditional psychiatry and DSM-style diagnosis.
