# Assessment & Metrics in Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD)

This document provides clinicians, therapists, physicians, and researchers with structured tools for assessing emotional vectors, mapping stability fields, and evaluating trajectory patterns without relying on traditional diagnostic labels. These assessment frameworks translate EFD principles into practical, repeatable, and clinically useful methods.

## 1. Purpose of EFD Assessment

EFD assessment aims to:
- understand emotional behavior through vector properties
- map field distortions and attractor basins
- identify early-warning indicators for destabilization
- track intervention effects on field shape over time
- offer a non-pathologizing alternative to psychiatric diagnosis
- support trauma-informed, consent-centered practice
- make emotional life measurable and predictable

Unlike DSM-based assessment, EFD focuses on **movement**, **pattern**, and **field behavior**, not categories.

## 2. Core Assessment Dimensions

Assessment in EFD focuses on three interlocking domains:

### **A. Emotional Vector Properties (EVE)**
Clinicians assess:
- Magnitude (M)
- Direction (D)
- Velocity (V)
- Momentum (Mo)
- Resonance (R)
- Coherence (C)

These properties describe the “motion” of emotional experience.

### **B. Stability Field Properties (SFM)**
Clinicians assess:
- field coherence
- elasticity
- sensitivity
- density
- attractor basins
- thresholds
- fragmentation points
- relational safety levels

These properties define the emotional landscape.

### **C. Trajectory Patterns (PETM)**
Clinicians assess:
- escalation curves
- collapse funnels
- oscillation loops
- manic-acceleration patterns
- stabilization pathways

Together these form the predictive picture of emotional life.

## 3. EFD Intake: Field Mapping Interview

A structured intake guides clinicians in mapping the stability field. Key areas include:

### **1. Emotional Tempo**
- “How quickly do emotions shift?”
- “Do you feel pulled into patterns you can’t stop?”

### **2. Escalation Indicators**
- triggers
- sensory overload
- sleep disruption
- relational stress

### **3. Collapse Indicators**
- fatigue
- numbing
- shutdown
- withdrawal

### **4. Trauma Patterns**
- hyperarousal
- fragmentation
- avoidance
- oscillation between extremes

### **5. Relational Context**
- perceived safety
- misattunement history
- attachment dynamics

### **6. Physiological State**
- sleep cycles
- autonomic symptoms
- somatic cues
- energy levels

### **7. Environmental Pressures**
- overstimulation
- instability
- chronic overwhelm

This creates the baseline field map.

## 4. EVE Clinical Rating Scale

A simple, reproducible metric for clinicians evaluating each vector parameter:

### **Magnitude (M)**
1 = low/numb  
3 = moderate  
5 = high/intense  

### **Direction (D)**
1 = withdrawal/collapse  
3 = stable engagement  
5 = defensive/manic acceleration  

### **Velocity (V)**
1 = slow shifts  
3 = moderate  
5 = rapid fluctuations  

### **Momentum (Mo)**
1 = easily shifted  
3 = moderately persistent  
5 = extremely persistent  

### **Resonance (R)**
1 = low reactivity  
3 = moderate  
5 = hypersensitive  

### **Coherence (C)**
1 = fragmented  
3 = somewhat organized  
5 = stable/integrated  

Clinicians record these per session and track trends over time.

## 5. Field Rating Scale (FRS)

The Stability Field Model requires assessing overall field shape:

### **Coherence**
1 fragmented → 5 integrated

### **Elasticity**
1 brittle → 5 resilient

### **Sensitivity**
1 low awareness → 5 hypervigilant

### **Density**
1 empty/numb → 5 heavy/congested

### **Attractor Basins**
1 weak → 5 strong pull

### **Threshold Stability**
1 unstable → 5 robust

The FRS can be completed weekly or monthly.

## 6. Trajectory Prediction Checklist (TP-C)

A quick tool for anticipating trajectories using PETM:

### **Escalation Trajectory Indicators**
- rising magnitude  
- rapid thought patterns  
- sensory overload  
- decreased sleep  
- growing impulsivity  

### **Collapse Trajectory Indicators**
- slowing of movement  
- heaviness  
- withdrawal  
- cognitive fog  
- emotional flattening  

### **Oscillation Trajectory Indicators**
- rapid mood swings  
- alternating states  
- relational hypersensitivity  
- exhaustion following spikes  

### **Mania-Acceleration Indicators**
- escalating energy  
- reduced need for sleep  
- increased goal orientation  
- heightened confidence  
- reduced thresholds  

Clinicians use this checklist to intervene early.

## 7. Field Map Templates

EFD provides simple templates that clinicians can adapt:

### **Template A: Daily Field Log**
- vector trends  
- field shifts  
- triggers  
- stabilizing events  
- physiological changes

### **Template B: Trajectory Map**
- predicted path  
- early signs  
- intervention points  
- expected outcomes  

### **Template C: Session Field Dynamics Log**
- changes in coherence  
- relational shifts  
- sensory load  
- momentum adjustments  

These templates allow real-time tracking of emotional movement.

## 8. Metrics for Clinical Progress

Instead of “symptom reduction,” EFD measures:

### **1. Increased Field Coherence**
- more predictable emotional movement  
- fewer sudden shifts  

### **2. Reduced Sensitivity**
- fewer disproportionate reactions  

### **3. Increased Elasticity**
- faster recovery from stress  

### **4. Decreased Density**
- less emotional heaviness or numbness  

### **5. Stabilized Trajectory Patterns**
- fewer spirals  
- fewer collapse cycles  
- reduced manic acceleration  

### **6. Strengthened Relational Safety**
- greater felt sense of stability  
- reduced defensiveness  
- increased trust and connection  

These metrics reflect genuine healing, not symptom suppression.

## 9. Summary

This assessment framework provides clinicians with structured, non-pathologizing, trauma-informed tools for understanding emotional life through vector properties, field dynamics, and trajectory patterns. These metrics enable early intervention, deeper understanding, and long-term transformation—without relying on traditional diagnostic categories or coercive methods.
