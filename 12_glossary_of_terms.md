# Glossary of Terms for Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD)

This glossary provides clear, accessible definitions of all major concepts used in Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD). It is designed as a quick-reference tool for clinicians, researchers, therapists, and scholars applying this framework in practice.

---

# A

### **Activation**
The level of physiological and emotional arousal present in the system. Often reflected in heart rate, breath tempo, muscle tone, and emotional intensity.

### **Attractor Basin**
A stable emotional pattern that the nervous system gravitates toward under stress (e.g., anxiety oscillation, depressive collapse, defensive hyperarousal). Not a disorder but a field tendency.

---

# C

### **Coherence**
The degree to which emotional signals are integrated and organized across the nervous system. High coherence → clarity, calm, stability. Low coherence → fragmentation, volatility.

### **Collapse**
A low-energy field state marked by withdrawal, numbness, shutdown, or dissociation. Driven by low magnitude, low velocity, and high density.

### **Consent (Clinical)**
Active, ongoing, trauma-informed participation in treatment. Central ethical principle in EFD; replaces coercion and force-driven interventions.

---

# D

### **Density**
How much emotional “weight” or unprocessed material exists in the field. High density feels heavy, congested, or overwhelming.

### **Direction (Vector)**
The behavioral orientation of an emotional vector: approach, withdraw, defend, expand, collapse, oscillate.

### **Dysregulation**
A mismatch between an emotional vector and the stability field. Not a disorder but a predictable field-physics event.

---

# E

### **Elasticity**
The field’s capacity to stretch, absorb stress, and return to baseline without collapsing or fragmenting. High elasticity → resilience.

### **Emotional Vector**
A dynamic emotional state defined by magnitude, direction, velocity, momentum, resonance, and coherence. Core building block of EFD.

### **Emotional Vector Equation (EVE)**
Mathematical framework describing how emotional vectors move and evolve through the stability field over time.

### **Escalation**
A trajectory toward high activation, often leading to panic, rage, or mania. Defined by rising magnitude, velocity, and resonance.

---

# F

### **Field Distortion**
A trauma-shaped alteration in the stability field (e.g., constriction, fragmentation, brittleness). Creates predictable dysregulation patterns.

### **Field Mapping**
Assessment process for identifying the structure, distortions, thresholds, and attractor basins of the stability field.

---

# H

### **Hyperarousal**
High-activation state marked by fear, vigilance, intensity, or defensive engagement. Typically associated with high magnitude, velocity, and resonance.

---

# I

### **Integration**
The process of emotional material being processed and resolved within a coherent field. Never forced; emerges naturally from stability.

---

# M

### **Magnitude**
The intensity or amplitude of an emotional vector.

### **Mania-Acceleration Curve**
A trajectory marked by rapidly rising magnitude, velocity, and decreasing thresholds. Early intervention focuses on grounding, slowing, and reducing stimulation.

### **Momentum**
The persistence or “carry-through” of an emotional vector once activated. High momentum states are difficult to stop.

---

# O

### **Oscillation**
A repeating pattern of rapid shifts between high and low activation states. Common in trauma-driven fields lacking coherence.

---

# P

### **Pacing (Relational)**
The speed and intensity of relational engagement. A key tool for regulating the client’s field and preventing overwhelm or escalation.

### **Panic Spiral**
A rapid escalation trajectory caused by rising magnitude, velocity, resonance, and falling coherence.

### **Predictive Emotional Trajectory Model (PETM)**
Framework for forecasting emotional movement based on vector properties and field shape.

---

# R

### **Regulation Engine**
Clinical application layer of EFD that uses field-level interventions to stabilize emotional trajectories.

### **Relational Safety**
The degree to which a client feels understood, seen, and safe with another person. Essential for field coherence.

### **Resonance**
The degree to which an emotional vector is amplified by internal or external signals.

---

# S

### **Sensitivity**
How reactive the field is to stimuli. High sensitivity often emerges from trauma and leads to hypervigilance or overwhelm.

### **Shutdown**
A collapse state triggered when the field becomes overwhelmed. Characterized by low magnitude, low velocity, and limited responsiveness.

### **Stability Field**
The total dynamic environment within the nervous system that shapes emotional movement. Defined by coherence, elasticity, sensitivity, density, thresholds, and attractor basins.

---

# T

### **Threshold**
The point at which the field becomes destabilized, triggering panic, shutdown, rage, or manic acceleration. Thresholds vary and can be strengthened through field-level interventions.

### **Trajectory**
The path an emotional vector follows through the stability field over time. Determined by EVE and PETM.

### **Trauma**
A force that alters the stability field, reshaping thresholds, coherence, sensitivity, and emotional movement. Understood not as an event but as a long-term field distortion.

---

# U

### **Upregulation / Downregulation**
Adjusting activation levels through somatic, relational, cognitive, or environmental interventions. Tools for shaping the stability field.

# Summary

This glossary provides clinicians and researchers with a consistent vocabulary for understanding and applying Emotional Field Dynamics. These definitions bring clarity, precision, and accessibility to the framework, enabling effective communication and practice across diverse professional settings.
