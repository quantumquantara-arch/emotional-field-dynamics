# Clinical Workbook Templates for Emotional Field Dynamics (EFD)

These worksheets are designed for clinicians, therapists, researchers, and clients to use in sessions or between sessions. They operationalize Emotional Vector Dynamics (EVE), the Stability Field Model (SFM), and the Predictive Emotional Trajectory Model (PETM) into practical, structured tools.

Each template may be printed, digitized, or integrated into electronic health systems.

# Summary

These templates translate Emotional Field Dynamics into everyday clinical practice and real-world client use. They enable pattern recognition, early detection, stabilization, and long-term transformation without diagnostic labels or coercive interventions.

Additional templates can be added as needed.
